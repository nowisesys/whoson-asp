
DEPLOYMENT DESCRIPTION FOR WHOSON ASP.NET
---------------------------------------------

This file documents the deployment of this web service application on IIS 6.0.

** Requirements:

   This ASP.NET application has been tested with these versions. Other versions might 
   work as well, but at least ASP.NET 1.1 will fail.
   
   o) ASP.NET version 2.0 (tested with 2.0.50727)
   o) IIS 6.0 (windows XP/Windows 2003) and 7.5 (Windows 2008). 
   o) Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (production).

** Setup:

   Download the SQL database script from http://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/proj/whoson/sql/
   and create a database. Run the SQL script to initialize an MSSQL or MySQL database.
   
   Create a directory for WhosOn ASP.NET. I like to keep applications outside of the
   web root and use a virtual directory pointing at this folder.
   
   Install instructions: http://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/proj/whoson/asp/install.php
   
** Connection String (database):

   Create a connection string named "WhosOnData" by selecting the web application in
   the IIS 7 manager and double-click on "Application Development -> Connection Strings". 

   a) Using integrated security:

      "Server=<server>;Database=<schema>;Integrated Security=true".

   b) Using SQL login:

      "Data Source=<ipaddr>,1433;Initial Catalog=<schema>;User ID=<user>;Password=<pass>"

   Replace options within <>.
   
** Application pool:

   Using integrated security for database connection will work if users are 
   authenticating when connecting to the web service. If the web service is 
   called anonymous, then the identity of the application pool can be configured
   to run under an unpriviledged account. 
   
   If the IIS and SQL database is located on different hosts, then the account 
   should be created in the domain.
