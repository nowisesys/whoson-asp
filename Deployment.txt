This file documents the deployment options. The installation has been tested on 
IIS 6.0 (windows XP/Windows 2003) and 7.5 (Windows 2008). The used database was
MS SQL Server 2008 R2 (production).

** Connection String (database):

   Create a connection string named "WhosOnData". Replace options within <>.

   a) Using integrated security:

      "Server=<server>;Database=<schema>;Integrated Security=true".

   b) Using SQL login:

      "Data Source=<ipaddr>,1433;Initial Catalog=<schema>;User ID=<user>;Password=<pass>"
   
** Application pool:

   Using integrated security for database connection will work if users are 
   authenticating when connecting to the web service. If the web service is 
   called anonymous, then the identity of the application pool can be configured
   to run under an unpriviledged account. 
   
   If the IIS and SQL database is located on different hosts, then the account 
   should be created in the domain.
