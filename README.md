# WhosOn logon accounting

WhosOn is a client/server system for logon accounting. Use either whoson-php 
or whoson-asp on server side, with whoson-sql for SQL support. Install the 
Linux, Mac OS X or Windows client on computers from who logon session statistics 
should be collected.

### Deployment:

Easiest is to record events by running the client as a logon/logoff script 
from i.e. an active directory GPO. The client can also be run as a service/daemon 
on client computers, monitoring user logons in the background.

### Records:

Recorded data has IP, hostname, MAC, username, domain and datetime as field
that is stored in the database. The client communicates with server side using
SOAP.

### Authentication:

By default, authentication is disabled on server side, but its possible to
enable HTTP basic authentication against i.e. LDAP or plain text file.

### This component:

Provides a server-side component of the WhosOn application. Deploy this web 
service application on IIS 6.0/7.5 with ASP.NET 2.0. See Deployment.txt for 
more information.
